# InfoSovaWebPartPack - Heading web part

Heading is the simplest web part in this web part package for SharePoint Online. It is used to provide the SharePoint online page editor with the ability to add caption or heading elements to the page.

On the following image, you can see the **Heading** web part in action. Here multiple designs for headings are displayed, but typically, you will decide on the design of the headings, and use these headings consistently on the page by copying a configured web part and changing the label or maybe the icon.
